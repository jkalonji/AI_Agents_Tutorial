**Financial Data Assistant**

This assistant can answer questions about stock prices, financial news, and other market-related information.


*What Does This Code Do?*

This script sets up an intelligent agent that can access various financial data sources and answer questions about the stock market. Here's a breakdown of its main functions:

  - It imports necessary tools and libraries for handling financial data and creating an AI agent.
  - It securely stores API keys for different financial data services.
  - It creates a specialized financial agent that can understand and process financial information.
  - The agent can answer questions about stocks, such as "What was the last closing price of Amazon?"


*How Does It Work ?*

  - Setting Up API Keys: The script uses API keys to access different financial data services. These keys are stored securely as environment variables.
  - Creating the Financial Tool: The script sets up a tool (FinanceAgentToolSpec) that can access various financial data sources using the API keys.
  - Building the AI Agent: An OpenAI-powered agent is created using the financial tool. This agent can understand natural language questions and use the financial tool to find answers.
  - Asking Questions: You can ask the agent questions about financial data, and it will use its tools to find and provide the answer.



Example Usage
At the end of the script, there's an example of how to use the agent:

      response = agent.chat("What was the last closing price of amazon?")
      print(response)

This line asks the agent about Amazon's last closing stock price, and the agent will respond with the information.



*Why Is This Useful?*

This script creates a powerful tool for anyone interested in financial data. Instead of manually searching through multiple sources, you can simply ask questions in plain English, and the AI assistant will find and provide the information for you. 
It's like having a knowledgeable financial analyst at your fingertips! 


Note: To use this script, you'll need to set up the required API keys for the financial data services and OpenAI. 
Make sure to keep these keys secure and never share them publicly.
